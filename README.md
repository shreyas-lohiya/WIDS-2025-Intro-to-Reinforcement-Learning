The goal of this project is to introduce you to the world of RL(hence the name) in a easy way by learning the relevant theory and implementing the algorithms to solve a few puzzles.

## Week 0
Most data science and ML is done using Python. So we need you to have atleast a basic understanding of it.(Trust me, it will be useful for you in the future as well!). For this project, you will also need to know the two importnt python modules numpy and matplotlib. For these we have attached relevant resources below

### Resources for Python

This is a good video but long, should keep you occupied for a bit.

### Resources for Numpy

### Resources for Matplotlib

You can just look up what plot you want at that moment for matplotlib or

We have also provided a few Jupyter tutorial notebooks on python, numpy and matplotlib for your practice! They can be found [here](./Week%200/)

### (Optional) Resources for Git

This isn’t strictly required for the project, but learning Git will be extremely useful for your future work. If you'd like to get started, here’s a great beginner-friendly lecture:

## Week 1:

In this week, you're gonna work on the Multi-Bandit Problem from Sutton and Barto (available in the resources folder) and explore the idea of the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.

## Week 2:

This week will consist of understand and coding MDPs as well as understanding the Bellman optimality equations.
